# Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion with TensorFlow

This project uses TensorFlow to build and train a supervised machine learning model that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit. The model is based on a simple neural network with one layer and one neuron, making it a great introductory project for understanding how neural networks can be used in regression problems.

## Project Overview

In this project, I'm are using a supervised learning approach where we provide the model with input-output pairs (Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures). The model learns the relationship between the two and creates a simple algorithm for conversion. The goal is to predict Fahrenheit values based on input Celsius values using a trained neural network.

### Key Features:
- A neural network with **one layer** and **one neuron**.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the **loss function**.
- Adam optimizer with a **learning rate** of 0.1.
- **500 epochs** for training.
- Includes my **personal notes and annotations** throughout the code for better understanding.

## Notes and Annotations

Throughout the project, I have included my own **notes and annotations** to explain various parts of the code and provide insights into how the model works. These notes cover topics like supervised learning, layers in neural networks, loss functions, optimizers, and more. The comments also include areas I plan to research further, making this project a living document for continuous learning.

## Loss Function Graph

Below is the graph showing how the loss of the model (inaccuracy) decreases as the training progresses through each epoch:
